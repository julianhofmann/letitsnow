==================
Quick installation
==================

In a :ref:`composer-based TYPO3 installation <t3start:install>` you can install
the extension EXT:letitsnow via composer:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require xitnelat/letitsnow

In TYPO3 installations above version 11.5 the extension will be automatically
installed. You do not have to activate it manually.

If you are using an older version of TYPO3 or have a legacy installation
without composer:

#. Visit ExtensionManager

#. Switch over to `Get Extensions`

#. Search for `letitsnow`

#. Install extension
